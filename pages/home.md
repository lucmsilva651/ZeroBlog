# ZeroBlog

**ZeroBlog** is an open-source blogging platform for hosting websites and blogs using Markdown files. It is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by [zero-md](https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md).

ZeroBlog requires no build tools, frameworks, or server-side technologies, so there is no need for Node.js, PHP, or any backend runtime. All content is rendered client-side, directly in the visitor’s browser. As a result, ZeroBlog can be deployed to any static file host or web server—such as GitHub Pages, or a local server—without installation steps or compilation.

## Key Characteristics

- Minimal and dependency-free
- Compatible with any static hosting environment
- Markdown-based content rendering using Web Components
- No build process or server logic required

## Usage Notes

ZeroBlog does not include a post index, navigation menu, or automatic post listing. Each page corresponds to a Markdown file and is accessed directly via its URL. To share a post, you must provide the direct link to the corresponding page. There is no built-in discovery or browsing interface.

## Alternatives

If you're looking for more advanced features such as CMS integration, content indexing, or plugin ecosystems, consider using:

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
